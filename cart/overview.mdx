## About the Cart

The Cart system functions as your digital shopping basket for purchasing mashup variants. Think of it as your pre-purchase staging area.


## How It Works

1. Add mashups to cart using "Add to Cart" button
2. System automatically checks:
   - If you already own the track
   - Available variants
   - Your credit balance
   - Cart capacity

<Note>
After purchase, tracks move to your Collections folder, where you can add them to your Crate for downloading.
</Note>
