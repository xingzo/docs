## About the Crate

The Crate is your digital record bag, managing downloads for purchased mashups. This is where you can actually download your mashups.

## How It Works

1. Add purchased tracks to your Crate from:
   - Collections page
   - Direct Crate view
   - Quick-add buttons throughout the app
2. Download tracks from your Crate
3. Track downloads in the [Download Library](/downloads/library) 

<Note>
Your downloads are available in the download library for 24 hours, allowing retries without using additional credits.
</Note>

### Limits
