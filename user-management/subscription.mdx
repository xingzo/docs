## Subscription Management

Your Afro Extended subscription can be managed through our secure customer portal, powered by Stripe. This portal provides you with complete control over your subscription and billing preferences.

### Current Plan Details

When you access the customer portal, you'll see your current subscription information including:
- Your active plan tier (Standard/Premium/Premium Plus)
- Monthly credit allocation
- Next billing date
- Recent payment history

## Managing Your Subscription

### Access the Customer Portal

To manage your subscription, simply click "Manage Subscription" in your account settings. This will securely redirect you to our customer portal where you can:

- Update your payment method
- Change your subscription plan
- View your billing history
- Update billing information
- Download invoices
- Manage automatic payments

### Plan Changes

Through the customer portal, you can easily upgrade to a higher tier to access more features and credits, or adjust your plan based on your needs. Our portal provides a clear comparison of available plans to help you make the best choice for your requirements.

<Note>
Any changes to your subscription plan will take effect at the start of your next billing cycle. Your current credits and benefits remain available until then.
</Note>

<Tip>
If you've used all your credits and need more immediately, you can cancel your current plan and subscribe to a new plan to receive a fresh credit allocation right away.
</Tip>

<Warning>
If you choose to cancel your subscription, you'll continue to have access to your current plan until the end of your billing period. After that, any unused credits will expire.
