## Account Protection

Your Afro Extended account security is essential for protecting your professional content and maintaining exclusive access to your downloads. We've implemented comprehensive security features to keep your account safe.

### Password Management

A strong password is your first line of defense. We recommend changing your password regularly and using a unique combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. Your password should be at least 12 characters long and not used on any other services.

When creating a new password, consider these guidelines:
- Include both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Add numbers and special characters
- Avoid using personal information
- Use a unique password for your Afro Extended account

### Active Sessions

Monitor your account's active sessions to ensure only authorized access to your content. The Active Sessions dashboard shows you detailed information about every device currently logged into your account. You can view:

Your current session displays important details including:
- The device name and type
- Location of access
- Time of last activity
- Browser or app information

If you notice any suspicious activity, you can immediately end that session remotely.

## Device Management

Keep track of all devices that access your Afro Extended account. The Device Management system provides comprehensive control over your account access points.

### Authorized Devices

Each device that logs into your account is registered in your authorized devices list. You can:

View detailed information about each device, including when it was last active and its location. Managing your devices is straightforward - you can remove any device you no longer use or don't recognize with a single click.

### Security Alerts

We actively monitor your account for unusual activity. You'll receive immediate notifications when:
- A new device logs into your account
