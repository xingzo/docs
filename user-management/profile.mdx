## Profile Essentials

Your Afro Extended profile represents your professional identity in the DJ community. A complete profile helps you connect with other professionals and enhances your experience on the platform.

### Profile Picture

Your profile picture is often the first thing others see. Choose a high-resolution professional image that represents you as a DJ. The image should be in a square format (1:1 ratio) and must not exceed 10MB in size. 

### Professional Identity

Your name on Afro Extended should reflect your professional DJ identity. You can use your real name or your DJ nameâ€”whichever you're known by in the industry. This name will appear across all platform features and interactions.

### Contact Information

#### Email Management

Your email preferences are central to how you receive important updates and communications. You can add multiple email addresses to your account and designate one as your primary contact. Each new email address requires verification to ensure the security of your account.

We'll send you notifications about:
- New track releases
- Credit updates
- Subscription renewals
- Platform announcements

You have full control over which notifications you receive and how they're delivered.

#### Connected Accounts

Streamline your login experience by connecting your social accounts. Currently, you can link your profile with:
- Google account
- GitHub profile

Connected accounts provide an additional layer of security and make signing in more convenient.

<Note>
Keep your profile information current to ensure you receive important updates and maintain professional connections within the community.
