### Access and Credits

Your membership consists of two key components:

- **Active Membership**: Provides access to browse and download mashups
- **Credits**: Determines how many tracks you can download

<Note>
While credits remain in your account indefinitely, you need an active membership to use them.

### Payment Options

We've designed our payment system to be flexible and convenient for our members. You can choose to pay using either a credit card or PayPal for your subscription. Currently, we offer a straightforward monthly billing cycle to keep things simple.

### Billing Process

Your subscription will automatically renew each month on your billing date. We'll process the payment using your chosen payment method, and you'll receive a confirmation email for each transaction. You can cancel your subscription at any time before your next billing cycle.

### Understanding Your Membership Status

When your membership is active, you'll have complete access to our platform, including the ability to browse our extensive library and download tracks using your available credits.

If you choose not to maintain an active subscription, your account will transition to our Free Plan. While you'll still be able to browse our catalog and access the platform, downloading capabilities will be temporarily suspended. Don't worry thoughâ€”any unused credits in your account are safely preserved and will become available again as soon as you reactivate your membership.
