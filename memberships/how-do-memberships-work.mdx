### Understanding Your Membership Status

When your membership is active, you'll have complete access to our platform, including the ability to browse our extensive library and download tracks using your available credits.

If you choose not to maintain an active subscription, your account will transition to our Free Plan. While you'll still be able to browse our catalog and access the platform, downloading capabilities will be temporarily suspended. Don't worry thoughâ€”any unused credits in your account are safely preserved and will become available again as soon as you reactivate your membership.

### Payment Options

You can choose to pay using all major credit cards such as Visa, Mastercard, as well as other popular payment methods like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and more.

### Billing Process

Your subscription will automatically renew each month on your billing date. For example: If you signed up on January 15th, your next billing date would be February 15th. 

Note: Payments are automatic, should you wish to avoid future charges make sure to cancel at least 72 hours prior to your billing date to ensure no funds will be applied to your account. Automatic payments can begin to process up to 48 hours before your billing date so it is imperative the subscription is canceled within that 72-hour window.

No refunds will be issued once payment has been applied to your account.
